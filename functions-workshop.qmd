## Welcome!


### Some intentions for the session:

* I want to get you writing some functions
* I want you to 'get' something about the way a function works
* I want you to feel safe to ask questions and try things out.

## Intended outcome: {.center}

* I hope as a result of today you will be able to write your own
functions, as and when you find them useful.

## Structure

* Writing very simple functions
* What is a function anyway?
* Function arguments
* Using functions to improve repetitive code


## Over to RStudio...

::: {.nonincremental}
* Writing a very (very!) basic function
:::

*
