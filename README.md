# Understanding functions in R

This is an introductory-level workshop aimed at analysts who can write `R` code
but who don't really get what functions are yet.

We'll be turning some repetitive code into functions, and learning:

* how to make a function
* what makes functions useful for analysts.

I coded for ages before I understood what the point of functions was.
And then I went through the torment of trying to learn how to use them!

Now I use them all the time... and I would never go back.

This workshop will explain why, and you'll be learning through doing.


### Pre-requisites

* You are someone who can write at least some basic `R` code.
* To play along, you will need to have `R`, and RStudio or VSCode etc.,
  installed and working on your computer.
* Ideally you will also be able to clone a GitHub repository into an RStudio
  project, but if not the code can be emailed out as a zip file instead.
