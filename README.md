# Understanding functions in R

This is an introductory-level workshop aimed at analysts who can write R code
but who don't really get what functions are yet.

We'll be turning some repetitive code into functions, and learning:

- how to make a function,
- what makes functions useful for analysts.

I coded for ages before I understood what the point of functions was.
And then I went through the torment of trying to learn how to use them!

Now I use them all the time and I would never go back.
This workshop will explain why, and you'll be learning through doing.
